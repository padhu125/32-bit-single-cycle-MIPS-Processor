Designed and verified a 32-bit single cycle MIPS processor on Quartus Prime Lite and ModelSim respectively using VHDL, that supports memory reference, arithmetic-logical, conditional branch, add immediate and jump instructions. A theoretical 4-stage (fetch, decode, execute and writeback) pipelined multicycle version of the processor was also designed thatâ€™s capable of solving data and RAW data hazard using forwarding technique and pipeline stalls, and control hazard using prediction.
